# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository. You will be prompted to select
which packages have changed, the type of change (major, minor, or patch), and a summary of the change.

A changeset file will be created in this directory. Commit the file along with your changes.

When the `release` workflow runs on `master`, it will consume all pending changesets, bump versions,
update changelogs, and publish to npm.
